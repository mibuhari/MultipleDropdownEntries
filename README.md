# MultipleDropdownEntries
If you wish to have a Google Sheet where you could add multiple entries from dropdown list into a cell, you could do the following:
1. Create a new Google Sheet.
2. Add the App Script (code.gs) using Extensions --> Apps Script
3. Add a file for Page.html

When you reopen the newly created Google Sheet, you will get a separate menu (Multiple Dropdown). When you click that, you will see "Show Dialog". Use this to see the list for selection.
